            "Praga can be a very interesting place with its architecture. Prague, capital city of the Czech Republic,
            is bisected by the Vltava River. Nicknamed “the City of a Hundred Spires,” it's known for its 
            Old Town Square, the heart of its historic core, with colorful baroque buildings, Gothic churches and the 
            medieval Astronomical Clock."
